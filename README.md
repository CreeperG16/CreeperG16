# I'm Tom.
## This is my profile.

I like to code random things.
I use JavaScript and TypeScript, mostly with Node.JS, some React and some React Native. I have experience coding Discord bots with [discord.js][1] too. I also know Lua, Python (but I don't use it often), a little C#, a little Bash, and I can write `Hello World` in countless other languages.

I mostly like to mess around with Minecraft Bedrock. I am familiar with its protocol, and I occasionally contribute to [PrismarineJS][2] projects. I'm currently helping develop [SerenityJS][7], a Bedrock Edition server software written from the ground up in TypeScript and Rust, and every now and then helping to bring [bedrock support][6] to [Mineflayer][3], among other things. I also like to make [Scripts for Onix Client][4], which is a legit bedrock modification client. These scripts use Lua, and that's where I learned Lua from. I also help making things for [CubeEdge Studios][5], which is a group of useful projects that my friend and I like to code in our free time.

Outside of coding, my hobbies are playing the guitar, playing other instruments with considerably less skill, cycling, trying to get myself to start editing videos again, trying to acquire more free time, and procrastinating.
